--- EXTRACTION PROMPT FOR CHUNK CENTERED ON PAGE 1 ---


    You are an expert at analyzing survey data from OCR-processed documents.

    Your task is to extract all questions and answers from the following survey text chunk in a structured format.
    
    This is a chunk of text (chunk_1) that may span across page boundaries.
    The chunk contains content from multiple pages with '<<<' markers indicating page breaks.
    

    IMPORTANT CHUNK PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS:
    - This chunk may contain content from multiple pages
    - The '<<<' markers indicate page breaks
    - Pay special attention to questions and answers that span across these page break markers
    - When you see a question right before a '<<<' marker, look for its answer right after the marker
    - When you see an answer at the beginning of the chunk (before any question), it likely belongs to a question from the previous page

    CRITICAL SPATIAL AWARENESS INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Survey forms often have complex layouts where answers don't always appear directly below or beside their questions
    - Scan the ENTIRE document space including headers, footers, margins, and floating elements for potential answers
    - Pay special attention to:
      * Headers/letterheads (often contain institution/company names, dates, ID numbers)
      * Floating text boxes/fields (may contain answers to questions that appear elsewhere)
      * Text in different columns that may be related
      * Information in margins or page corners
      * Titles and subtitles that contain relevant information
    - Be aware that some answers may appear visually separated from their questions in the original form
    - For questions asking about names, addresses, dates, or identifiers, check page headers and document metadata
    - Match answers to questions based on context and content, not just proximity
    - When dealing with page breaks ('<<<'), remember that important contextual information might be split across pages

    For each question:
    1. Extract the question ID (e.g., Q2.3, Q3.1) if present. If no ID is explicitly shown, generate a sequential one.
    2. Extract the complete question text, including any asterisks (*) that denote required fields.
    3. Identify all possible answer options.
    4. Determine which answer was selected based on:
       - Checkboxes: Look for [X], â˜‘, or similar marks
       - Radio buttons: Look for filled circles or selected options
       - Text fields: Extract the text entered
       - Multiple selections: If multiple options are checked, include ALL of them as a list
    5. Identify any section headers or organizational elements.

    Very important rules:
    - Pay special attention to cases where a question appears right before a '<<<' marker and its answer appears right after it
    - Look for standalone answers at the top of a chunk that might belong to questions from the previous page
    - For isolated answers like "2+" or "Yes" that appear at the start of the chunk, try to match them to the last question that appears in the previous section (before the first '<<<' marker)
    - For questions at the end of the chunk (after the last '<<<' marker) that don't have answers, mark them as "[INCOMPLETE]"
    - If there are multiple checked boxes for a question, include all selected options as an array
    - For free-text responses, include the complete answer text

    Format your response in JSON structure as follows:
    ```json
    {
      "sections": [
        {
          "title": "Section Title",
          "questions": [
            {
              "id": "Q1.1",
              "text": "Full question text",
              "options": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"],
              "selected": "Option 2"
            },
            {
              "id": "Q1.2",
              "text": "Multiple-select question text",
              "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
              "selected": ["Option A", "Option C"]
            },
            ...
          ]
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
    ```

    If a question appears incomplete, extract what you can and indicate with "[INCOMPLETE]" in the text field.
    If something is ambiguous, indicate this with "[UNCLEAR]".
