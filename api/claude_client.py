You are an expert at analyzing survey data from OCR-processed documents. 

Your task is to extract all questions and answers from the following survey page in a structured format.
{context}

For each question:
1. Extract the question ID (e.g., Q2.3, Q3.1) if present. If no ID is explicitly shown, generate a sequential one.
2. Extract the complete question text, including any asterisks (*) that denote required fields.
3. Identify all possible answer options.
4. Determine which answer was selected based on:
   - Checkboxes: Look for [X], â˜‘, or similar marks
   - Radio buttons: Look for filled circles or selected options
   - Text fields: Extract the text entered
   - Multiple selections: If multiple options are checked, include ALL of them as a list
5. Identify any section headers or organizational elements.

CRITICAL SPATIAL AWARENESS INSTRUCTIONS:
- Survey forms often have complex layouts where answers don't always appear directly below or beside their questions
- Scan the ENTIRE document space including headers, footers, margins, and floating elements for potential answers
- Pay special attention to:
  * Multi-column layouts where questions and answers may appear in separate columns
  * Headers/letterheads (often contain institution/company names, dates, ID numbers)
  * Floating text boxes/fields (may contain answers to questions that appear elsewhere)
  * Text in different columns that may be related
  * Information in margins or page corners
  * Titles and subtitles that contain relevant information
- Be aware that some answers may appear visually separated from their questions in the original form
- For questions asking about names, addresses, dates, or identifiers, check page headers and document metadata
- Match answers to questions based on context and content, not just proximity
- Watch for indented text blocks below questions (like "20 per month") which are likely the answers to those questions

MULTI-COLUMN LAYOUT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Many forms use side-by-side columns that get linearized in OCR text with large spaces
- When you see lots of spaces in a line, it likely indicates content from different columns
- Content from the left column often continues for several lines before content from the right column appears
- Text that appears indented under a question ID (like "11.") and has no other question nearby is likely the answer
- Look for answers that appear in the same column as their questions but may be separated by text from other columns

Very important rules:
- Ensure you extract EVERY question on the page, even if it appears to be a continuation from another page
- Pay special attention to formatting like checkboxes, bullet points, and asterisks
- If there are multiple checked boxes for a single question, make sure to include all selected options as an array
- For free-text responses, include the complete answer text
- If a question appears incomplete (continuing to another page), add "[INCOMPLETE]" to the text field
- Look for special markers like [LIKELY_ANSWER_TO_Q19: 2+] which indicate answers to questions across pages
- If you see a standalone answer like "2+" or "Yes" at the top of the page, it might be an answer to a question from the previous page

YOU MUST FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS VALID JSON without any extra explanation. Return ONLY the JSON data.
Format your response in JSON structure as follows:
```json
{{
  "sections": [
    {{
      "title": "Section Title",
      "questions": [
        {{
          "id": "Q1.1",
          "text": "Full question text",
          "options": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"],

        }},
        ...
      ]
    }},
    ...
  ]
}}
```

If you only see partial questions (continuing from a previous page or continuing to the next page), extract what you can and indicate with "[INCOMPLETE]" in the text field.

Accurately preserve all information while fixing any OCR artifacts or formatting issues. If something is ambiguous, indicate this with "[UNCLEAR]".

If you see a "Next Page Preview" section, use this information to understand the context of questions but don't extract questions from that preview section.

IMPORTANT CHUNK PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS:
- This chunk may contain content from multiple pages
- The '<<<' markers indicate page breaks
- Pay special attention to questions and answers that span across these page break markers
- When you see a question right before a '<<<' marker, look for its answer right after the marker
- When you see an answer at the beginning of the chunk (before any question), it likely belongs to a question from the previous page

- For questions asking about names, addresses, dates, or identifiers, check page headers and document metadata
- Match answers to questions based on context and content, not just proximity
- When dealing with page breaks ('<<<'), remember that important contextual information might be split across pages

- Look for standalone answers at the top of a chunk that might belong to questions from the previous page
- For isolated answers like "2+" or "Yes" that appear at the start of the chunk, try to match them to the last question that appears in the previous section (before the first '<<<' marker)
- For questions at the end of the chunk (after the last '<<<' marker) that don't have answers, mark them as "[INCOMPLETE]"
- If there are multiple checked boxes for a question, include all selected options as an array

If a question appears incomplete, extract what you can and indicate with "[INCOMPLETE]" in the text field.
If something is ambiguous, indicate this with "[UNCLEAR]".

Here is the OCR text chunk to analyze:

    def get_classifier_prompt(self, text: str, file_extension: str, is_chunk: bool = False, chunk_info: str = "") -> str:
        """
        Generate a classification prompt for provider identification
        
        Args:
            text: The OCR text to analyze
            file_extension: File extension (e.g., "pdf")
            is_chunk: Whether this is a chunk of a larger document
            chunk_info: Information about the chunk position
            
        Returns:
            Complete prompt for provider classification
        """
        prompt = f"""Identify the survey provider from the OCR text. You MUST return ONLY ONE of these exact values (no additional text):
SURVEY_MONKEY
GOOGLE_FORMS
QUALTRICS
PDF
MICROSOFT_WORD
MICROSOFT_FORMS
NULL

Look for indicators such as:
- Provider-specific layouts, logos or branding elements
- Platform-specific question formats or styling
- URLs or email domains related to the provider
- Copyright notices or footers mentioning the provider
- Form structure that matches a specific platform

IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS:
- Microsoft Word documents often have checkboxes ([ ] or [X]) for forms - this does NOT mean it's Microsoft Forms
- Microsoft Forms will specifically have a forms.office.com URL or Microsoft Forms branding
- Look for file paths with .doc or .docx extensions which indicate Microsoft Word documents
- Microsoft Word forms typically have more complex/custom layouts and formatting than Microsoft Forms
- Microsoft Forms has a very specific look with consistent question styling and automatic numbering
- Only classify as MICROSOFT_FORMS if you see clear evidence of the Microsoft Forms platform

If you can't identify a specific provider, respond with "PDF" for PDF files or "MICROSOFT_WORD" for Word documents, based on the file type.
If you can't determine anything, respond with "NULL".

This is a {file_extension.upper()} document{" - " + chunk_info if is_chunk else ""} with the following OCR text:
{text[:3000]}

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY ONE of the allowed values with no additional text or explanation.
